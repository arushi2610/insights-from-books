## Leadership
- We need women leaders who aren't afraid to take chances and who aren't afraid to fail. 
- There is more than one way to be a leader. 
- A leader is a servant to the people around her, and not one of them. She is the one others look to for inspiration and guidance. 
- As a leader, the things you say matter to the people you lead. 
- A lot of people will listen to you as a leader and as a representative of your company. Be mindful of the image you're presenting.

- When putting a team together, a mix of personalities and level of respect for each other's skills is very important. 
- As a leader, it's your responsiblity to take care of your people. 

## Entrepreneurship
- One of the most frightening things to deal with as you're starting something is that somewhere, some other genius is working on the same idea you are. 
- Do not get so caught up in your idea that you forget to produce. 
- Worry about only two things: talk to users to find out what they want & iterate your working product ASAP.
- Take some time to work on yourself, your abilities, your sense of responsibility and your ability to solve conflicts before jumping into the startup world. 
- Startups are the only real way for a woman to get power in tech. 

## Co-Founder

- Start with someone who you think works as much or harder than you, whose skills complement yours, and who has excellent communication skills. 
- Business and hardwork in a startup can drain and exhaust you. Having a solid partners can lift that burden.

## Personal Branding
- You cannot hide who you are. The only thing you can do is accept each of your parts and be proud of what you've become. 
- There are parts of your identity you can keep secret and there are parts you cannot. 
- You cannot have a personal identity on the internet that makes you feel happy and also expect that no one judges you. 
- When you have even a modicum of information, start sharing it with others. 
- You don't have to be perfect to be a mentor. 
- If you want it, get out there and build it. 

## Career

- When there are no statistics proving that we can achieve our dreams, sometimes we have to take a leap of faith.
