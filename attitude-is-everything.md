# Attitude is Everything

*by Jeff Keller*

## The Power of Our Thoughts
- We become what we think about.
- What the mind can concieve and believe, the mind can achieve.
- There is nothing on earth you cannot have - once you have mentally accepted the fact that you can have it.
- When your dominant belief is that you can acheive your goal, you begin taking the actions necessary to move in that direction.
- You must first clearly see a thing in your mind before you can do it.
- You are limited only by your imagination.
- To change your circumstances, first start thinking differently.

## The Power of Our Words
- Repeat anything often enough and it will start to become you.
- The words you consistently select, will shape your destiny.
- Words are the most powerful drug used by mankind.
- In words are seen the state of mind, charachter and disposition of the speaker.
- Choose words that will point you in the direction of your goals.
- Whatever you hear, over and over will be at the forefront of your consciousness.

## What Fear Makes Us Do
- Do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain.
- If you want to be successful, you must be willing to be uncomfortable.
- Consider yourself an immediate winner when you take the first step and do the thing you fear.
- The only way to escape from the poison of fear is action.
- Confront your fears and be willing to expand your comfort zone.
- The courage muscle can be developed just like any other muscle - with exercise.
- When you push through and take action in some areas of your life, you'll develop confidence in another areas as well.
- You won't develop your abilities to the fullest unless you're willing to be uncomfortable.
- Confront your fears and you are on the way to developing your potential and leading the exciting, fulfilling life you deserve. It's a decision you'll never regret!

## Failure Is A Lesson
- Failure is only the opportunity to more intelligently begin again.
- There is no such thing as failure. There are only results.
- Failure is essential for growth.
- When you're not afraid to fail, you're well on the way to success.
- Welcome failure as an unavoidable yet vital component in the quest to achieve your goals.
- Your failures are learning expereinces that point out the adjustments you must make.
- Never try to hide from failure.
- You may be disappointed if you fail, but you're doomed if you don't try.
- You often have to let go of some things in your life and take a few steps backwards before you can move forward in a new direction.
- No pressure, no diamonds.
- The things which hurt, instruct.
- When one door shuts, there is always a better one waiting to be opened.
- Problems are often life's way of letting you know that you're off course and need to take corrective action.
- Every adversity carries with it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.
- We percieve falling off as a bad thing rather than an essential part of achieving our goal.
- To reach your goal, you must be committed to doing what it takes to get there. Even if it means putting up with negative feedback or falling.
- Have the guts to confront your fears, because that's where your potential will be developed - by doing things you're afraid to do.

## Your Environment
- There are issues you have to deal with, when you take a stand in life. You have to face the fact that some people will disapprove of your decisions.
- We become part of what we are around.
- Your friends will stretch your vision or choke your dreams.
- Human beings are like sponges, we 'soak up' whatever people around us are saying.
- As adults, most of us become a lot more concerned about the opinions of others, often hesitating because people may laugh at us or criticize us.
- Resist the temptation to compare your progress with that of anyone else. You'll advance faster than some, and slower than others.
- Surround yourself with people who support and believe in you.

## The Power of Taking Action
- Success requires effort, commitment and patience.
- The key to getting what you want is the 'willingness to do whatever it takes.'
- When you make a commitment, and are willing to do whatever it takes, you begin to attract the people and circumstances necessary to accomplish your goal.
- Never, never give up.
- The rewards for those who persevere far exceed the pain that must precede the victory.
- The greatest mistake a person can make is to be afraid of making one.
- The only time success is impossible is when you quit.
- Continued attempts, with commitment and diligence, can be turned into success.
- Success is usually achieved by one step at a time.
- Banish any thought of giving up till you reach your objective.

## Networking
- You can get everything in life you want if you'll just help enough other people get what they want.
- The more solid relationship you build, the greater your opportunities for success.
- You can succeed best by helping others to succeed.
- Take advantage of everyday opportunities to meet people.
- At seminars, make it a point to meet different people.
