# Attitude is Everything

*by Jeff Keller*

- There are issues you have to deal with, when you take a stand in life. You have to face the fact that some people will disapprove of your decisions.
- You often have to let go of some things in your life and take a few steps backwards before you can move forward in a new direction.
- We become what we think about.
- What the mind can concieve and believe, the mind can achieve.
- There is nothing on earth you cannot have - once you have mentally accepted the fact that you can have it.
- When your dominant belief is that you can cheive your goal, you begin taking the actions necessary to move in that direction.
- Success requires effort, commitment and patience.
- You must first clearly see a thing in your mind before you can do it.
- You are limited only by your imagination.
- The key to getting what you want is the 'willingness to do whatever it takes.'
- When you make a commitment, and are willing to do whatever it takes, you begin to attract the people and circumstances necessary to accomplish your goal.
- Never, never give up.
- The rewards for those who persevere
